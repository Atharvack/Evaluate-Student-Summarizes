# Evaluate-Student-Summarizes
This project aims to automatically assess the quality of summaries written by students in grades 3-12. The goal is to build a model that evaluates how well a student represents the main idea and details of a source text, as well as the clarity, precision, and fluency of the language used in the summary.
